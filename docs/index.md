# GitHub GUI Project!!


# Description of Project:

We partnered up with Microsoft to build a GUI prototype which will let users run Git commands from a Java program, instead of running them from terminal. This program will also automate the process of putting an existing project on a computer up to GitHub. To build this project we used two jar files: GitSubprocessClient and GitHubApiClient. This project turns the existing project into a GitHub repository and also creates a gitIgnore file which includes some common files name which user would like to avoid seeing on the repository. When the user uses the GUI, it will also make the initial commit and also create a README.md file which contains the name of the project in file. We also give users option to make their repository private or public and when they are done making the repository, they are provided with the new link to their GitHub repository.

# How to run this project:

To run this project, you will need minimum Java 1.8 version. You can clone this project to your computer and press the start button. After that, you will enter the directory path of the project that you would like to turn into GitHub repo. You can pick either you want it to be public or private. You can hit the create repository button and, you will receive a link your newly created GitHub repository which will have an initial commit, gitIgnore file, and README.md file.
